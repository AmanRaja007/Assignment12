    "Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes. Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application.\n",

In other applications, performance can be unaffected or even degraded by using multithreading and multicontexting together. How performance is affected depends on your application.\n",

    "4.Reduced number of required servers:- Because one server can dispatch multiple service threads, the number of servers to start for your application is reduced.

    "A deadlock is when two (or more) threads are blocking each other. Usually this has something to do with threads trying to acquire shared resources. For example if threads T1 and T2 need to acquire both resources A and B in order to do their work. If T1 acquires resource A, then T2 acquires resource B, T1 could then be waiting for resource B while T2 was waiting for resource A. In this case, both threads will wait indefinitely for the resource held by the other thread. These threads are said to be deadlocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when two threads interact in a negatve (buggy) way depending on the exact order that their different instructions are executed. If one thread sets a global variable, for example, then a second thread reads and modifies that global variable, and the first thread reads the variable, the first thread may experience a bug because the variable has changed unexpectedly."
